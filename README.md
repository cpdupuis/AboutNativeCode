## Outline: features to explore

* Compiling code
  * Source code -> object code
* Static Libraries
  * Making a .a library
  * Static linking
* Dynamic Libraries
  * Making a .so library
  * Linking to a shared library
  * Multiple versions of shared libraries
  * Loading shared libraries from code
